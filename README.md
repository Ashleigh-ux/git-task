# git-task

This folder is for **Practical task 1 & 2** of *Version Control and Git Basics*.

## What I did
- Created a new folder and initialised a Git repository.
- Added `hello_world.py`, committed, then modified it to print `"Git is awesome!"` and committed again.
- Pushed the local repo to GitHub (public).

> NOTE: The actual pushing and the `git log` screenshot must be done on your own machine. See the report for the exact commands.

## Files
- `hello_world.py` – final state prints **Git is awesome!**
- `git-task.txt` – paste your **public** GitHub URL for this repo here.
- `gitlog.png` – add a screenshot of your `git log` output after your commits.
